#Planned Features

#1)Implement sprinting, crouching, and auto-jump to improve player maneuvering
   a) As a Craft user, I want to be able to double tap the w key and sprint so that movement feels more natural.
   b) As a Craft user, I want to be able to hold the shift key to crouch, so my character will not fall off of blocks.
   c) As a Craft user, I want there to be an auto-jump feature, so that I don't have to press space all the time.
   
#2)Add bobbing effect to movement, and change field of view when sprinting to improve feedback to player
  a) As a Craft user, I want the player experience to feel more like actual minecraft, with camera bobbing to make movement       more fluid.
  b) As a Craft user, I want the player's field of view to change when sprinting in game to enhance the feel of sprinting.

#3)Create a GUI on hitting 'M' so the player can pause the game, then select a resume button to resume or an exit button to leave the program
  a) As a Craft user, I want to be able to pause my game of craft when I want to take a break.
  b) As a Craft user, I want to see a menu when I pause the game so that I can select to either resume or exit the game.

#4)Implement some form of command line to switch between game-modes


#5)Implement auto walking button press to improve ability to control your character.
  a) As a Craft user, I want to be able to auto walk so that I don't have to constantly hold my movement button.
